# Laravel AI integration with Auditing.

This project presents a robust web application developed in Laravel (PHP), 
with the primary goal of **optimizing and supporting the auditing workflow**. 
By integrating **Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities**, the platform aims 
to automate the analysis of large volumes of data, identify patterns and 
anomalies with greater accuracy and speed than manual methods, and provide 
predictive insights for auditors. 

The combination of the Laravel framework for a **secure and intuitive** user 
interface with the analytical power of AI results in a tool that **increases 
efficiency, reduces the risk of human error, and elevates the overall quality** 
of internal and external audits.

## 🚀 Getting started

These instructions will allow you to obtain a working copy of the project on your 
local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 📋 Prerequisites

You will need the following software installed on your machine:

```
PHP version 8.5

Composer

Node.js and npm (or Yarn)

Database MySQL or SQLite

Git
```

### ⚙️ Setting Up the Project Locally

Open your terminal or command prompt and run 
the following command to download the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/AndreGregoletto/laravel-auditoria-ia.git

cd [name-of-work-space]
```

Build the container:

```
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

Copy .env.example to .env:

```
docker cp .env.example laravel-php:/var/www/.env
```

Access the container and install the Composer dependencies:

```
docker exec -it laravel-php bash

composer install

php artisan key:generate

php artisan migrate

npm install

npm run build
```

If you are using SQLite, run the following commands:

```
docker exec -it laravel-php bash

chown -R www-data:www-data database/

chmod 775 database/database.sqlit
 
chmod 775 database/
```


If everything goes as expected, the application will be available to be 
accessed on port 8000.


## 📦 Implantation

This application is an essential working tool for the auditor, created to 
drastically optimize the routine analysis. Instead of manually reviewing 
spreadsheets, the platform uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate 
all the processing, normalization, and identification of anomalies across 
large volumes of data. The goal is for the auditor to dedicate their time 
only to the final review of the risk insights generated by the AI, 
validating the findings and making strategic decisions, effectively 
transforming the auditor from an executor into a strategic supervisor of 
the process.
